# Public Greenspace in Ashland, KY

Using open source data from google satellite and streetview, I was able to isolate my small town.  I created a greenspace data set and then created multipoint polygons to highlight the public green spaces in the city limits from the banks of the Ohio River back to edge of Ashland.

### What is it for?

I wanted to create this map as to help with our citywide goal of encouraging the population to become more active.  There are multiple locations throughout our city that could be greater utilized in making a more active community.  The simplest solution is highlighting the infrastructure that is already in place.  All of the highlighted spaces feature trails, activities, or fitness equipment that could help get people active.

#### How was it created?

First, I found our town using the google satellite xyz tile. Next, I created a temporary scratch layer and added the attribute table for green spaces.  I edited this layer and added a polygon feature.  I selected multiple points to outline each green space and labeled them accordingly. I also added a north marker, scale bar, and legend.
